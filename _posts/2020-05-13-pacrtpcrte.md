First Post!

Today I want to spend just a couple of minutes talking about Pentester Academy's Attacking and Defending Active Directory and the Red Team Labs.
At first, it may seem strange to talk about two separate courses in a single post, but I think by the end of this post you will see why it may be appropriate.

## PA Attacking and Defending Active Directory Course and Lab
This is a great course. It may be the best way to really understand all of the concepts that you have been hearing about in InfoSec talks over the past decade as it relates to PowerShell and Active Directory. Have the concepts of Over Pass the Hash and Delegation types been missing from your toolbelt? This course will teach it to you. Overall, the more than 10 hours of video content and the lab manual will give you all of the information needed to really start tearing into basic AD environments. 
That being said, the course and the lab go hand in hand. I’m not saying that the course work prepares you for the lab. I am saying that the course work IS the lab environment. Everything that is shown in the course is done directly in the lab environment to include all of the lab walkthrough documents and PowerPoints that are also provided in the course. If you want more of a challenge, stay tuned for the next section on the Red Team Labs.

## PA Attacking and Defending Active Directory Exam (CRTP)
Just to get this out of the way… if you followed along in the course material and understood everything, you probably are not going to need anywhere near 24 hours to complete the exam. Personally, it took about 3 hours to complete and another 2 hours for the report. However, it was still a very enjoyable exam and environment to really solidify the concepts taught in the course. I’m afraid there isn’t much more to say on that note. Learn the material, have fun on the exam, and call it a day.

## PA Red Team Lab Course and Lab Environment
If you have already completed the Attacking and Defending course, don’t bother looking at the course material. It more or less contains the exact same information but with less detail. I would jump straight into the lab and get cracking. 
I have to say, the lab environment is awesome. There were a few different directions that you could go in that made it feel more like a real environment. Meaning, you aren’t necessarily pigeonholed into a specific exploit vector until you have cleared a few machines. Each machine teaches a valuable lesson and is put together thoughtfully.

## PA Red Team Lab Exam (CRTE)
I was honestly a little underwhelmed by this exam. The exam lab is a little lacking compared to the lab environment in terms of reinforcing major concepts. Additionally, there was a major glitch with some of the bot activity that left me completely stuck for almost 24 hours. By the time that I had tried everything that I could think of multiple times including machine restarts (you will have permission to reboot remote machines), I reached out to support. From there, it took them about 8 or so hours to respond and grant a machine revert. After they reverted the machine in question, I tried my techniques again and instantly got a shell. So overall, I probably wasted nearly 24 hours on that machine alone. After that, it was pretty simple to get the next couple of machines and submit the report.

## Final Thoughts
Honestly, I believe that these two courses could really be combined into one. The course material and training from Attacking and Defending AD could be provided with the Red Team Lab material. Keep the Red Team lab the way it is, and maybe reuse the exam from Attacking and Defending on the Red Team Lab exam. In other words, the Attacking and Defending lab environment was almost pointless by the time the course showed you all of the techniques, and the Red Team Lab exam wasn’t all that impressive compared to the red team lab itself and the Attacking and Defending exam. If that is a little confusing, I understand, but maybe the new PACES lab and exam will tie the two even closer together. 
The verdict is that both packages are extremely attractive in their own ways, but I just wish that they were somehow combined and slightly tweaked in their presentation.
