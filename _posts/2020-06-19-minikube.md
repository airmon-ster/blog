Virtualization Inception!

## *Post Blog EDIT*
After posting this and having issues with minikube freezing up after VM hibernation and refusing to restart (go ahead and Google minikube errors and you will see that it is not recommended most of the time), I discovered a snap named microk8s. I would highly recommend this snap as opposed to the minikube/kubectl combo. Ubuntu snaps are similar to containers, but they are for applications instead of OS environments. Meaning, all of the dependencies and whatnot are contained within the snap itself and doesnt require mucking up your base OS with a bunch of non-sense. In other words, snaps are similar to python virtual environments except that they actually work ```;)```   
So go ahead and read this blog post, but promptly forget it and install microk8s instead! More information can be found on the [Kubernetes Blog on microk8s](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/11/26/running-kubernetes-locally-on-linux-with-microk8s/)

## Original Post

I am a gamer. I use my desktop for gaming. This means that I run Windows.

However, for a lot of the development environment that I set up, this means that I often have to rig it to work with Windows in one way or the other. Perhaps I run Ubuntu on top of Windows via Linux Subsystem for Windows…. Well, I refer you back to the first statement. I use my computer for gaming. That being said, I was tired of sacrificing processing power with all of the extra services and packages that I install over time for all of my development projects. It may not be much, but after a few months of installing a bunch of tools and services, my gaming performance takes a hit. This led me to using an Ubuntu VM with VMWare full time when developing projects. 

Now to the point. When I started using Kubernetes more (K8), I ran into a few issues where I was running my Ubuntu VM on my Windows machine. Kubernetes requires yet another VM to host all of its services. This means that I would be forced to run a VM within a VM, which in turn, requires more virtualization support that I didn’t want to mess with. Of course, the smart people working on Kubernetes knew this and gave us the ```--driver=none``` switch that allows us to run the Kubernetes cluster directly on the underlying OS instead of spawning a new VM, but this requires root access and a bunch of sym-linking between environmental variables that is also a major headache. 

Enter docker. As you may know, Kubernetes is used to serve docker containers. Did you also know that you can use a docker container to spawn your Kubernetes cluster that spawns your docker containers? I sure didn’t. This means that I can now use my Windows computer to launch my Ubuntu VM dev machine, which will run a docker container which will run my Kubernetes cluster which will run my docker containers. Luckily, there are smart people out there that put this together allowing me to come in and just put the pieces together. 
The only small hitch is that you have to dedicate a terminal that points your current minikube environment into the minikube-docker environment. This will allow you to pull images from outside of the minikube docker environment. I understand that at this point, it is all getting rather confusing, so let’s take a look at a couple of screenshots to fill in the gaps.

From a clean terminal, start minikube with the following command (kubectl should already be installed):    
```minikube start –driver=docker```

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![](/assets/images/minikube/minikubestart.jpg)
{: refdef}
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
*Minikube starting for the first time*
{: refdef}

After that, the following command will point our current minikube instance into its docker container:   
```eval $(minikube docker-env)```
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![](/assets/images/minikube/dockerpsdockerenv.jpg)
{: refdef}
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
*Listing docker containers within minikube*
{: refdef}

To confirm that the environment has changed, pull up another terminal and run a docker ps again.   
```docker ps```
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![](/assets/images/minikube/dockerps.jpg)
{: refdef}
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
*Listing docker containers on the Ubuntu VM outside of minikube*
{: refdef}

After all of this, you should now be able to use the terminal that it pointed inside of minikube to apply all of your K8 deployments and pods. 

## Final Thoughts
I understand that this is a pretty small corner case, but I ran into several issues while figuring all of this out. Not to mention, these instructions will help anybody running K8/docker on a Linux distro either way.
